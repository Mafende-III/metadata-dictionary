# DHIS2 Metadata Dictionary - Enhanced SQL View Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the systematic implementation of enhanced SQL view features into the working metadata dictionary system. The approach is designed to prevent timeout issues and maintain system stability.

## Implementation Strategy
- **Incremental Development**: Add features one phase at a time
- **Test-Driven**: Verify each phase before proceeding
- **Rollback Ready**: Commit after each successful phase
- **Performance First**: Monitor for timeout issues throughout

## Phase 1: System Reset âœ… COMPLETED
**Goal**: Return to stable working state

### Tasks Completed:
- [x] Create backup branch `backup-current-state`
- [x] Add backup branch to `.gitignore`
- [x] Reset to last working commit (ee33134)
- [x] Clean workspace of untracked files
- [x] Verify basic functionality works

**Result**: Clean working system with "Explore Now" button functioning properly

## Phase 2: Enhanced SQL View UI Components
**Goal**: Add enhanced UI components without breaking existing functionality

### Tasks:
- [ ] Copy enhanced SQL view components from `ENHANCED_SQL_VIEW_FEATURES.md`
- [ ] Implement `EnhancedSqlViewFlow.tsx` component
- [ ] Add `ItemSelector.tsx` for group-based filtering
- [ ] Create `ProcessingProgress.tsx` for real-time updates
- [ ] Add `IncrementalResultsDisplay.tsx` for live results

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] All existing pages still work
- [ ] Enhanced components render without errors
- [ ] No impact on dictionary browsing functionality

---

## Phase 3: Enhanced Processing Services
**Goal**: Add enhanced processing logic and services

### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement `parameterizedSqlViewService.ts`
- [ ] Add `metadataGroupService.ts` for group filtering
- [ ] Create `dhis2Service.ts` for enhanced API calls
- [ ] Add processing queue management
- [ ] Implement individual item processing

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Services integrate without breaking existing API calls
- [ ] Processing queue functions correctly
- [ ] No impact on current dictionary generation

---

## Phase 4: Enhanced API Endpoints
**Goal**: Add new API endpoints for enhanced functionality

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create `/api/dhis2/sql-views/execute/` endpoint
- [ ] Add `/api/dictionaries/save-from-enhanced/` endpoint
- [ ] Implement group-based processing endpoints
- [ ] Add real-time progress tracking APIs

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] New endpoints work correctly
- [ ] Existing API endpoints remain functional
- [ ] Enhanced processing prevents timeout errors

---

## Phase 5: Enhanced State Management
**Goal**: Add enhanced state management for complex workflows

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create enhanced stores in `stores/` directory
- [ ] Implement processing state management
- [ ] Add real-time update capabilities
- [ ] Create enhanced caching mechanisms

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] State management works reliably
- [ ] Real-time updates function correctly
- [ ] No memory leaks or performance issues

---

## Phase 6: Integration & Testing
**Goal**: Integrate all enhanced features and test thoroughly

### Tasks:
- [ ] Connect all enhanced components
- [ ] Test complete enhanced workflow
- [ ] Verify timeout prevention works
- [ ] Test all existing functionality still works
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Enhanced SQL view flow works end-to-end
- [ ] No timeout errors on large datasets
- [ ] All existing features remain functional
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

---

## Phase 7: Documentation & Deployment
**Goal**: Document and prepare for production

### Tasks:
- [ ] Update user documentation
- [ ] Create deployment guide
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with new features
- [ ] Test production deployment
- [ ] Create rollback procedures

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] System is ready for production use
- [ ] Rollback procedures are tested

## Key Reference Files
- **ENHANCED_SQL_VIEW_FEATURES.md**: Core feature specifications
- **ENHANCED_ACTION_TRACKING_GUIDE.md**: Action tracking implementation
- **ENHANCED_EXPORT_IMPLEMENTATION.md**: Export functionality details
- **dhis2-metadata-enhanced.html**: UI/UX reference prototype

## Emergency Procedures
If any phase causes issues:
1. Stop implementation immediately
2. Revert to previous working commit
3. Review phase requirements
4. Adjust implementation approach
5. Test thoroughly before proceeding

## Success Metrics
- **No timeout errors** on large datasets
- **Real-time processing** with progress tracking
- **All existing functionality** remains intact
- **Enhanced features** work as specified
- **Performance** is acceptable for production use
